# Module 1 Challenge Code Refactor

## Description 
What: In this challenge, I have refactored existing code. This was an on-the-job ticket where I modified existing starter code. Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing code, without changing its original functionality. 

Why: I completed this challenge because it addresses an important aspect of all web development - accessibility. I followed the Scout Rule. This means,when working with code that was not originally written by yourself, you should always leave it a little 'cleaner' than you found it. 

There are a few benefits to refactoring code. It makes it cleaner so it is easier to read and understand, it is easier for software developers to identify and fix bugs, and makes the code more resuable/it can be duplicated, again increasing efficiency and readibility. 

How: I have ensured the website meets the accessibility sgandards by completing the following: 
<ul>
  <li>Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code</li>
  <li>HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning</li>
  <li>Image and icon elements contain accessible alt attributes</li>
  <li>Heading attributes fall in sequential order</li>
  <li>Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title</li>
</ul>

## Installation

1. Create a new repository on your GitHub account and clone it to your computer.

2. Add the starter code to the new repo on your computer and work through the Challenge.

3. When you’re ready to deploy, use the git add, git commit, and git push commands to save and push your code to your GitHub repository.

4. Navigate to your GitHub repository in the browser and then select the Settings tab on the right side of the page.

5. On the Settings page, scroll down to the GitHub Pages section. Then, in the section labeled Source, select the main branch as your source.

6. Navigate to and you will find that your new webpage has gone live! For example, if your GitHub username is “lernantino” and the project is “css-demo-site”, then your URL would be .
